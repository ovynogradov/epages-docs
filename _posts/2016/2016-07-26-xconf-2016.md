Not so long time ago, in one of so few sunny days in Hamburg I have had an opportunity to visit
[XConf](https://info.thoughtworks.com/Xconf-hamburg-2016.html). Here in Epages, developers have a great support by the company if they are interested in self-education.

This yearly event took place in 12 of July in a cozy place [Betahaus](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/) in format of one day conference covering "broad range of technology topics".

Thanks to great job made by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) I have enjoyed time participating it.

Every participant could choose one of the two tracks running in parallel.
Track 1 has most interesting content for me personally and I decided to join it.
