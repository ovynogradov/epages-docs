Not so long time ago, in one of so few sunny days in Hamburg we have had an opportunity to visit
[XConf](https://info.thoughtworks.com/Xconf-hamburg-2016.html). Here in Epages, developers have a great support by the company if they are interested in self-education.

This yearly event took place in 12 of July in a cozy place [Betahaus](http://hamburg.betahaus.de/) in format of one day conference covering "broad range of technology topics".

Thanks to great job made by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) we have enjoyed time taking part at it.

## Keynote

[James Lewis](https://twitter.com/boicy) presented the keynote talking about Lean Software Enginering, [LEGO](http://lego.com) and Star Wars.
Sometimes when people explain processes they make theirs presentation too abstract and might loose the audience on the way.
What was interesting in this presentation, that he was able to illustrate in a form of a story, process problems and discussed ways of solving them. And everything with help of LEGO building a Millennium Falcon.
With such presentation techniques he was able to explain several concepts including cycle-time and  throughput, continuous process improvement to people who are not familiar with the topic.

## Presentations

Every participant could choose one of the two tracks running in parallel.

We have decided to visit Track 1, because there were topics we want to get more insides on how other companies are dealing with microservices.

### Track 1 topics:
 - Containerizing a web shop - Building the microservice platform for otto.de
 - Implementing Infrastructure as Code
 - A High-Performmance Solution to Microservice UI Composition
 - Serverless Architecture - Tales from a world without servers
 - Alert overload: How to adopt a MS architecture without being...

### Impression

In general the presentations were really nice: well structured content, experienced speakers and interesting topics.
One good outcome of the conference was to see that many companies are using and applying the same techniques and tools that we are using internally.

Especially, for us personally, it was really interesting to hear about experience of introducing microservices architecture on such giant environment as otto.de.

It is good to now that one of the leaders of German e-Commerce market following the same principles as we are following in our team.

Other interesting topic was the Infrastructure.
In ePages we have a quite sophisticated environment structure. To manage those, we are already applying many techniques and tools described by [Kief Morris] in his presentation.
